# Data Analytics - Final Project

**Overview:**

This data analytics project taking an ITSM Data Deep Dive to develop meaningful inferences.

**Objective:**

 - Study of 9 years of ITSM data to understand data trends. 
 - Deep dive into data trends, areas requiring most assistance.
 - Analysis of ticket inflow by time of the day and year.

**Goals:**

 - Develop meaningful inferences to assist management in allocation of funds and resources.
 - Identify areas requiring more user training and documentation.
 - Open up opportunities for process review in areas with most challenges.
 - At a deeper level, identify what can the IT organization do better and how?

**Process:**

 1. Setup GitHub repo
 2. Gather data for analysis
 3. Data cleaning - EDA
 4. Regression Analysis
 5. Develop visualizations

**Technology:**

1. Excel 
2. Python
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Tableau

**Inferences:**
5. Tickets increasing over years – could indicate growth in customer base. 
6. Most sought services – Account management, Computer Software, Network services.
7. Staff raise more tickets than students.
8. Proper ticket classification - missing for key services.
9. Student account setup - main pain point.
10. Account management tickets - highest at term start. 
11. Majority of the tickets get resolved at the first level of support. 

**Actionable Insights**
1. Additional resources required to keep up with the growth. 
2. Task force to curb tickets related to - Account management, Comp Software, Network services.
3. More awareness sessions to empower staff.
4. Ensure correct ticket classification to allow for meaningful inferences.
5. Revisit process for student account setup.
6. Add additional resources at peak periods. 
7. Tier 1 performance indicates a strong shift left strategy. 
 
**Future Plans**
1. Would like to dissect data trends based on customer personas.
2. Review impact of user base growth with ticket trends.
3. Prepare additional summary data sets based on raw data to develop meaningful regression analyses.
